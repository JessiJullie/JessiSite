The following is a scrubbed version of a hypothetical plan I laid out as a test exercise on how to plot out renewal and expansion for a strategic customer.

### General Details

**The setup:** Versayce has rolled out their initial implementation of FooBar and we are in the second year of service with six months until the next renewal. The current contract is a 1-year agreement at $250,000 total for access to 200 seats and 100 services monitored by FooBar. Out of Versayce's 500-person engineering team and platform with 250 services in their distributed architecture, they are using 158 seats and 70 services.

**The goal:** Bring FooBar utilization at Versayce in line with contract allotments and facilitate expansion across the organization in time for the upcoming contract renewal.

### Scope and Cadence of Engagement

At 158 active users on the platform and 1.5 years into their contract, I can safely assume that onsite training with their engineering teams (DevOps, QA, Developers) and technical support teams have already been conducted. At this juncture I will have developed solid working relationships with directors and team leads, so I would leverage those contacts to get a sense of their long term roadmap. Additionally, I’d aim for introductions to both the Product and Product Marketing team leads to talk about how FooBar can enhance their own initiatives. Alongside this, I’ll maintain a couple of office hours each week to facilitate adoption and schedule larger onsites with team leads for training and workshops.

### Collaboration with FooBar Internal Teams

Due to the size of this account and the fact it would be one client in my book of business, I would want to pull in the following people for light lifting:

* An account executive for renewal contract review. While I will likely use templates, having fresh eyes to look it over and provide feedback on expansion targets is key.

* A designer to create a polished and editable Versayce organization chart and services chart, as it relates to FooBar. This would be leveraged during negotiations and our own expansion planning.

* A solutions architect for at least one onsite and, depending on the SA’s bandwidth, sitting in on office hours or collaborating with me on any code workarounds Versayce might need.

### Usage and Revenue Outcomes

Services will likely outpace employee growth, so focusing on seats is secondary as expanding services per team will be key, especially as the cost per service add-on is higher than a cost per user. That said, for user expansion I would target product managers and product marketing managers because they’re the logical next step for a technical product like FooBar, after engineering teams adopt fully. I may also target the sales teams for training as well and show them how to view metrics related to their clients.

The other consideration is that there is, realistically, an upper cap of users and growth depending on funding rounds. Versayce’s most recent round was a Series C at $100M shortly before the second year contract signing. Unless I have good reason to believe they are aiming to secure a hefty Series D funding round within the next year, the bulk of their hiring expansion is done and services are the primary expansion target. Especially since they are nearly at the limit for users but lagging a bit on utilizing available services.


## Process and Timeline for Renewal

Assuming the contract is up for renewal in September 2020 and we are now in mid-February, I propose the following timeline:

**March 2020:**

: Partner with designer to create Versayce organization and services utilization charts.

: Setup meetings with directors/team leads already utilizing FooBar and identify new services to be monitored.

: Secure introductions through these meetings to the PM and PMM team leads to discuss their day-to-day and identify which personas on their teams could leverage FooBar.

: Schedule kickoff calls for PMs and PMMs (and possibly AEs) to say hello and identify opportunities on their teams.

**April 2020:**

: Work with internal contacts at Versayce to schedule a series of onsites with myself and a FooBar solutions engineer.

: Go onsite for a half or full day to train, get new users setup and take the directors/team leads out to lunch or dinner.

: Continue weekly calls and office hours to drive adoption.

**May 2020:**

: Partner with Versayce to create new internal documentation and playbooks that will drive new user and service expansions.

: Continue weekly calls and office hours to drive adoption.


**June 2020:**

: Possible onsite followup depending on how much more assistance they require.

: Continue weekly calls and office hours to drive adoption.

: Track adoption rates and see if we need to leverage an SA again to push usage slightly above the current contract limit.

**July 2020:**

: At this point I want to be about 5% over user and services limits. My reasoning here is that allowing a couple of months of overages demonstrates trust and generosity on our part. It’s also a great point to bring up when I meet with the main business contacts.

: Create slide deck showing their growth and adoption over time and target 30% increase users/services (and therefore annual price) for the next agreement.

: Go onsite, possibly with an AE to pitch the renewal along with making myself available for in-person office hours and working meetings.

**August 2020:**

: Continue weekly calls and office hours to drive adoption.

: Negotiate with Versayce to finalize the renewal and possibly bring annual cost down to 15-20% if needed. If they have big funding rounds in progress I would push for a much larger expansion and a 2-year agreement.

**September 2020:**

: Close the renewal, pop open a bottle of Moët with colleagues and bask in the glory.

: Send key contacts thoughtful gifts to thank them for continuing to be a customer.
