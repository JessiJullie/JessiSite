I am a customer success professional with years of experience working in post-sales client engagements. I'm skilled at running multiple large Enterprise projects concurrently as a technical point of contact and take them from introductory orientation of product to ongoing training resources and onto final phases of audits/testing. My focus is on PaaS and Saas products for Enterprise and Strategic clients; primarily tools for observability and performance monitoring, feature management, collaborative development, and application performance improvement.

If it makes developers’ lives easier, I’m interested in it. If it’s a new, cutting edge technology, I want to learn it. If it’s broken, I want to fix it.  

Before I knew the difference between a CLI and an API, my passion was education. My studies focused on sociology and gender with an emphasis on social science research. In graduate school, my Master’s Thesis investigated cultural schemas around gender roles and used a custom built site for data collection. After completing my Master of Arts degree, I continued teaching and ultimately designed and taught an upper division university course on Queer Cultures in Society. I’ve spoken in front of groups as small as three people in a room and as large as eight hundred people in a massive debate hall that required overflow rooms to accommodate the crowds.

After a decade of facilitating workshops, lecturing and working on education, I had the opportunity to manage an office for a seed-round startup part time. With a bit of experience in HTML and SQL, I saturated myself in the wild world of Drupal and open-source software, and took on more challenging technical roles. As a natural and life-long learner, I’ve leveled up my technical proficiency in git, containerized platforms, distributed systems, debugging applications, writing and executing load tests, and general problem solving around software integrations and product implementations.   

Recently, I took a sabbtical to freelance and do a bit of travel, returning from my adventures in Thailand, Laos and Indonesia just in time for a global pandemic to erupt. While social distancing has made looking for my next opportunity a bit unusual I am ready for salaried opportunities in technical account management or project management. I’m interested in exploring roles related to educational design as well as product management, so please get in touch if you’d like to chat with me about any freelance or salaried positions.
