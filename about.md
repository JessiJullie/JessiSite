I am a tech professional with over a decade of experience working in post-sales client engagements and internal technical enablement. I'm skilled at running multiple large strategic cross-collaborative projects concurrently as a problem-solving technical point of contact. My focus is on PaaS and Saas products for Enterprise and Strategic clients; primarily tools for observability and performance monitoring, feature management, collaborative development, and application performance improvement.

If it makes developers’ lives easier, I’m interested in it. If it’s a new, cutting edge technology, I want to learn it. If it’s broken, I want to fix it.  

Before I knew the difference between a CLI and an API, my passions were academic research and education. My studies focused on sociology and gender with an emphasis on social science research. In graduate school, my master’s thesis analyzed cultural schemas around gender roles and used a custom built site for data collection where users tagged videos (quantative) and provided predictive text (qualitative). After completing my Master of Arts degree, I continued teaching and ultimately designed and taught an upper division university course on Queer Cultures in Society. I’ve spoken in front of groups as small as three people in a room and as large as eight hundred people in a massive debate hall that required overflow rooms to accommodate the crowds.

After years of facilitating workshops, researching, lecturing and working on education, I had the opportunity to manage an office for a seed-round startup part time. With a bit of experience in HTML and SQL, I saturated myself in the wild world of Drupal and open-source software, and took on more challenging technical roles eventually leading to me work on a feature flagging platform. As a natural and life-long learner, I’ve leveled up my technical proficiency in git, containerized platforms, distributed systems, debugging applications, data analytics, system/application observability and general problem solving around software integrations and product implementations.  

Since 2020 I've been working hard with my fellow Splunkers to enhance all things O11Y as part of the industry's ongoing work to thoughtfully harness available machine data. When I'm not hyper-focused on customer problems I am always looking for new ways to make internal processes more efficient or tackling critical processes to support the business, whether pre-sales motions or established account teams. I love the feeling of seeing a concept click for someone and of watching a process remove daily burdens. The future is now, let's make it better together!
