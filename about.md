I’m a customer success professional with years of experience running multiple large Enterprise projects concurrently as a single point of contact, from introductory orientation of product to ongoing training resources and onto final phases of audits/testing. My focus is on PaaS and Saas products for Enterprise and Strategic clients; primarily tools for observability and performance monitoring, feature management, collaborative development, and application performance improvement.

If it makes developers’ lives easier, I’m interested in it. If it’s a new, cutting edge technology, I want to learn it. If it’s broken, I want to fix it.  

But before I knew the difference between a CLI and an API, my passion and calling was education. During undergrad my focus of study was sociology and gender with an emphasis on social science research. In graduate school, my Master’s Thesis investigated cultural schemas around gender roles and used a custom built site for data collection. After completing my Master of Arts degree, I continued teaching and ultimately designed and taught an upper division university course on Queer Cultures in Society. I’ve spoken in front of groups as small as three people in a room and as large as eight hundred people in a large debate hall that required overflow rooms to accommodate the crowds.

After a decade of facilitating workshops, lecturing and working on education, I had the opportunity to manage an office for a seed-round startup part time. While I had a small amount of experience with HTML and SQL, I went even further and saturated myself in the wild world of Drupal and open-source software in order to take on more challenging technical roles and grow my career. As a natural and life-long learner, I’ve leveled up my technical proficiency in git, containerized platforms, distributed systems, debugging applications, writing and executing load tests, and general problem solving around software integrations and product implementations. And I did all of this armed with nothing more than an internet connection, personal motivation and access to the incredible minds of my colleagues for questions.  

Recently, I decided to take a small break to freelance and do a bit of travel. Because of my impeccable sense of timing, I returned just in time for a global pandemic to erupt and have been continuing to work on small personal projects (such as building and launching this site) while keeping an eye out for salaried opportunities doing technical account management or project management. I’m also open to exploring roles related to educational design as well as product management, so please get in touch if you’d like to chat with me about any freelance or salaried positions.
